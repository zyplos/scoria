![Editor Screenshot](./screenshot.png)

A *really* dark theme for VSCode with hints of red, but with splashes of color to still make stuff stand out. Based off of [enenumxela's signed-dark-pro](https://github.com/enenumxela/vscode-signed-dark-pro).

Install this in your own VSCode instance by going to the Extensions panel and searching for "Scoria" by Zyplos, or visit the extension's page here: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zyplos.scoria

You may also preview this theme in your browser by visiting this link: https://vscode.dev/theme/zyplos.scoria/Scoria

This was originally made for VSCode v1.88.0 in Spring 2024. If you find anything that looks odd as a result of the latest updates, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/zyplos/scoria/issues).
